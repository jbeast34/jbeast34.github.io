In our I.T lesson this week  we learnt how to debug unwanted programing on the computers how we did was go through our website programing and check if there was anything wrong and if there was we had to manually correct it and then save it.we did this by selecting the wrong programming reading through it and then editing out what was wrong.because coding is very precise we needed to make sure that we did it correctly otherwise what we put won't work on our websites.
