Coding our buzzfeed quiz.

In this weeks lesson we started to actually code our quiz.We picked the questions and thought about what method we will use last lesson and wrote it all out for homework.My one was called how much money you are going to make when you are older.An example of one of the questions that i am going to do is "what would you rather do on a saturday?"The answers for this question are:‚Äùstay at home and play on my ipad/console,Do some extra school/job work,go out and do some exercise,go out with your mates.The way that the coding will work is that if you pick a certain answer e.g A it adds a low number like 1 to your score but if you pick e.g B then it will add 5 to you score.So the higher the score the more to one of the four outcomes and the other way around if you have a lower score.There are a couple of problems with this way of doing it.If you always have the code set to if you pick A add 1 to score then people will soon start to notice that all the same type of answers are in the same place each time, so to fix this i am going to copy and paste that little bit of coding that decides how much should be added on for each answer and change it slightly for each question.This should work and make it much more like a proper quiz.For homework i am just going to get a little bit further into the coding and getting the basic structure sorted.
