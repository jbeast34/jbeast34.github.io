In today's lesson we talked about the social media we use and what we use it for.we also talked about how it affects us now and about how it will affect us in the future.we watched a video about a policewoman who had posted something that was slightly racist online.soon loads of people knew about it including the people she worked with.because they all knew about the racist post they weren't acting normal around her.in the end she was shamed out of her job.this just shows how 1 unintentianal bad post might get you out of jobs.we talked about how important it is to not post or do anything on social media that we might regret later because it might have desastarous affects on you.
