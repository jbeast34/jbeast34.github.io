    <td>I read out the coding to my partner who wrote it down which was faster than writing and reading. We also starting using the wires and other parts i don't know the name of like lights and weird buttons.at first the light wasnt lighting so we had to switch stuff around or change places of things until it finaly started working.</td>

    <td>I will read the booklet more thoroughly and instead of just doing all of the obvious stuff to try and think around the problem try to think logically and work out proper reasons for why it might not be working instead of just guessing. </td>
