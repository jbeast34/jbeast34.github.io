In I.T this week we were continuing to make codes on javascript for our bbc micro bit so far i have done roll the dice,mood swings,flashpoint and worst snake ever.Javascript is a bit like scratch but a bit more technical than scratch.We got to follow various different tutorials for each different outcome.They get harder as you go along so that number 1 (roll the dice )is the easiest and number 6 (maze runner) is the hardest.The aim is to get through all of the tutorials so then we can do our own stuff and games without help from other people or tutorials.
