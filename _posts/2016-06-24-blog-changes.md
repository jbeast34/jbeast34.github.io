Today in the lesson i played around with my website testing out different types of colours and different fonts.in the end my blog website ended up looking a lot different than what it looked like before i messed around with it.i also figured out how to post blogs alot quiker than i had been doing before.overall from todays lesson i learnt a lot alhough i nearly destroyed my website.
