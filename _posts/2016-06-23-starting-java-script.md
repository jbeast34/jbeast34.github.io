In this week's lesson we started a programing site called bbc microbit.we use java script to make the codes for bbc microbit.there is 6 tutorials that we are meant to complete over a period of time.i have so far done the first one.it is a bit harder than scratch becouse in scratch its a little bit less technical than java script.some people have done up to 2  already.In the lesson i just managed to do one of the tutorials with a bit of help from the person next to me.in the end we both helped each other figure it out.i enjoyed scratch a bit more than java script becouse in scratch there thare is a lot of extra stuff like drawing and animating not just coding but in javascript it is all coding.another reason is that if you are not verry good at scratch you can still produce a good fun peice of work but if you are not that good at java script it is a lot harder to get somthing to work.
