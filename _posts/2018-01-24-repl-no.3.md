Starting our quiz.

In this weeks lesson we were talking about starting our own buzzfeed quiz.To get inspiration for what we could do or what it would be like we went and had a go at a couple of actual buzzfeed quizzes.For the most part they were surprisingly accurate (apart from one which guessed i was 27).After we had a bit of fun playing with the quizes we started to have a look at the techniques we could use to actually create one ourselves.We did this for a long time because there were many different possible ways, some better than others.I decided to do one of the more simple methods.For each question i would say that if they pick e.g A then it would add one to their score, or e.g C would add 6 to their score.Then i would rewrite the coding for each questions so that the same sort of answers are always in the same place.then depending on how high or low it is you will get one of the four answers.
