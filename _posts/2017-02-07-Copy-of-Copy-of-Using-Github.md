    <td>At first i just learnt by trial and error because i didn't really know what was going on and i was just getting to know the program.At first it also helped looking at others peoples work and helping each other.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

    <td>Because this was the first time using codecademy i wasn't really sure about a lot of things e.g knowing that if you do any tiny thing wrong like a capital letter it could completely mess all of the coding up.</td>

    <td>Next time i will try to work more independently.I will also try to work out the answers to questions instead of just desperately trying to guess them.I will also try to think about the questions a lot more logically.</td>
