Today in the lesson we learnt about how adverts use different perspectives to make us think differently about what they're showing and advertising.for example we saw a advert about fat people losing weight. It started with big black cars going round the corner of a narrow road with secret mission type music.we talked about how it could've been used for a FBI mission beginning or in some crime or drama film.they put that music and those cars in to grab your attention so you start watching the program and then they continue making it seem more interesting than it really would be without the music and extra stuff.
