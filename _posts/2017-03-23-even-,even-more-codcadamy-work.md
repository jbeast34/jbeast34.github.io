    <td>This lesson not much actually limited my learning because i was actually focusing a lot and working hard.and that is one of the reasons how i did so well in that lesson because i got  past my goal of 33.i don't think i need to work on any habits and instead just keep doing stuff like i did in this lesson.</td>
