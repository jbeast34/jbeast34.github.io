Today we learnt in our lesson the difference between sociopaths and psychopaths.First we were told a story about some psychopaths when they were younger:there was a small group of boys around thirteen.They skipped school to go and catch a seagull one they came back to the school they brutally ripped of a wing of the seagull and then put it into a plastic bag and then the kickers it around the corridor like a football until it died.

The difference between psychopaths and sociopaths is that psychopaths can't feel any one else's emotions and they often pretend that they have emotions and that they are normal.Unlike sociopaths they are laid back and if planning to do a bad crime they will often plan it out carefully before actually committing the crime.This makes psychopaths dangerous because they can go around doing bad stuff Even killing people without feeling anything for the victims.

Sociopaths are less dangerous than psychopaths because they can sometimes feel emotions often they can't feel that much emotion but sometimes they can.sociopaths don't really take note of rules or anything like that.If a sociopath does kill someone most of the time it won't be a planned attack it  would just be spontaneous and disorganised. Sociopaths also have fits of rage and emotional outbursts without realising it or deliberately doing it.
