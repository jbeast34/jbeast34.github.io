    <td>I pushed on when i was stuck on a question instead of instantly giving up and asking for help from the teacher or one of my classmates.When I was working on a question that I was stuck on I would keep going at it until I have finished when other people were talking.this helps because it makes you work hard so you can talk.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will try not to get distracted by other people talking or by myself when I get frustrated with a question that I can't do.This time I also thought to simply about difficult questions instead of actually using my brain and trying to figure what I should do different.</td>
