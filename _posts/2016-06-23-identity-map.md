In this weeks lesson we were looking at each others identity maps and rating them saying the good and the bad things about them on a piece of paper next to your work.the comments would be annonamus so people wouldnt know who had said what on their work.mr keen also came round to look at everyones work to rate it overall from a D to a A.if he gave your work a B or an A you would not have to do any extra work on it at home.but if you got below a B you would have to try to improve your peice of work at home.i got a B so i luckily didnt have to do any more work at home on it.overall their was a lot of diifferent types of identity maps some where mostly pictures, some were mostly writing,some were done by hand and much more.i liked the variaty that was in the different maps.
