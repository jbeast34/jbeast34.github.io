In this week's lesson we were introduced to a site called prezi.on the website you can make cool presentations that can move around and look cool to anyone who is watching.A Lot of people in class had never used prezi before so they don't know how it works but in my old school we spent a long time practising with it.we had a homework that was to mess around with it and to try everything so that the people who had never used it could get an idea about how it worked.but because i did it at my old school i had a big advantage so instead of having a mess around and a play with it i made a long presentation about drumming.
