    <td>we mainly were listening to mr keen and then doing little improvement and additions to our work because we had not done repl for a long time so we needed to get used to is again before we started doing anything serious.Concentration was very important as if we did not listen it would make life very difficult.</td>

    <td>I did fairly good this listen so there is not that much that I can do to improve apart from maybe listen a little  bit better as I was messing around a little bit with my code while he was talking so I could of possibly missed something important.that was probably tho only thing I could of improved on in that lesson.</td>

    <td>I will just have to not get tempted to fix my code when mr keen is talking otherwise I could miss something important.i could do this by quickly noting it down(what I need to fix) before the teacher starts talking or I could just try to remember it so then I don't have to write anything down.
