Today in the lesson we looked at a series of videos showing four people having a contest of who could reach a million views first.the whole thing was ok at first just a bit of a laugh but near the end it started getting serious like sending rally embarasing videos of each other naked and stuff.one everyone in their collage  had heard about it these people started getting bullied a bit so they took the Visio down from the internet but it was still around .so beacouse no one could get it down from the Internet beacouse it was all over the place they got help from teachers and in the end it was alright only just though.so in the lesson we got told if anything ever happens like that or you get creepy people texting you about private stuff or anything we should either go to a parent or a responsible adult but if you don't want to he gave us these two websites think u know or ceop.
