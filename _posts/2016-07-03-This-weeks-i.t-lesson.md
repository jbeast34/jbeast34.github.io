In this week's lesson I continued to change my blog post until I was happy about it.my friend who was sitting next to me showed me some stuff that I could do to my website including changing the 'blog' and 'aboutâ€™ link colour.i also started thinking about how I should start making the game because I have now tried 3 times but each time something doesn't work but this time I managed to get the first part of my script to work.in today's lesson we also started talking about how different words are offensive and about how some are more than others even though they should be the same. some of the words we use all the time as insults to each other and some at football and thong like that although some of them were words that we wouldn't normally use because we all knew how bad they were.we also did a survey about discrimination and about what's happening in the school.some of the questions was about you personally and some were about everyone overall.that survey only took five minutes so It didn't really disrupt what we were doing.
