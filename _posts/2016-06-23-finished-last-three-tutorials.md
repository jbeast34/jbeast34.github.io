I have now finished the tutorials and i thougt that they were a lot easyer than the ones before.now that i have done all 9 of the tutorials i have got a better understanding of javascript and how it works.i now can see that if i didnt do those tutorials i would find it realy hard to make my own game.My game is going to be rock paper sciccors and you play against the computor.the game is all about luck.i started it but i came accross alot of problems so i am going to do another approach to making the game wich hopefully might be a bit more succsesfull.
