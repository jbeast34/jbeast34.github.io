We are now nearly at the end of our java script tutorials i now have 3 left to do.since i first started working on java script i couldn't do anything but now i can do a lot more and i feel like i have improved a lot.the three left are called fortune teller interactive badge and against the clock.from other people telling me apparently the three end ones are easier than the other ones.For me the other ones took about 45 mins for each one but people have told me that these take around 15 to 20 mins.in the lesson we spent most of our time focasing on the work becouse if we get a lot done in the lesson we will have less to do for homework but i never finish what i am doing in the lesson anyway.
