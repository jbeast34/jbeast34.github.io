In last week's lesson we were expanding our knowledge on javascript by doing harder examples which turned out to be very challenging and time consuming.I have now done all six of the examples that our teacher set set us to do.We are still waiting for the actual microbits to arrive which were meant to arrive weeks and weeks ago.A lot off people are getting on to do their own and some people are finding it harder to get onto our own games.When i get on to doing my own game i will try to do a rock paper scissors game where the computer picks rock paper or scissors at random.
